## About

In the dawn of the 2000s, I was the advocate, urging everyone to craft their own websites to communicate openly. I introduced friends to the world of email and nudged them to join the likes of 'Friendster'. However, as the internet evolved into a voracious data harvester, my enthusiasm waned.

Yet, the desire to share persists. I've chosen to post my evolving spectrum of ideas here, rather than letting them drown in the toxicity of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or X.com or allowing those platforms to profit from them.

## Me

{{< /columns >}}

So here I amâ€”a Southern Californian for over a quarter-century, a husband, father, and technophile, always on the lookout for ways to harmoniously integrate technology into our lives without letting it overshadow or complicate our essence.

In the pursuit of life's treasures, I continually seek simplicity, patience, and compassion.
